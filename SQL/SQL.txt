SQL = Structured Query language)

SQL  queries can be divided into DDL, DML, DCL,TCL, DQL

DDL - data definition language
DML - data Manipulation "
DCL -  "  control         "
TCL - Transaction control  "
DQL - data query language

DDL :  creating, altering, drop, rename database and tables structure

DML : insert, update, delete the records into tables

DCL : grant and revoke the permission on the tables to other users

TCL : we can commit or rollback the transactions using save point

DQL : extracting the data from tables

To create a new DB: (DDL)
create database <dbname>;

To view all available DB in current login:

-> show databases;

To use or working on a DB: (DDL)

-> use <dbname>;

To create a table under a DB: (DDL)

create table tablename (columnname1 datatype, ..... columnnameN datatype);

** When we are creating a table we can define column with datatype, size and constraints or rules.

 
to insert records to table (DML)

insert into tablename values (value1,.... valueN);

to view all the records from a table

select * from tablename;(DQL)

to view structure of a table

describe tablename;(DDL)

desc tablename;

to know currently working DB: (DQL)
select database();

SQL 
Structured Query Language

Its a common language used in all DBMS/RDBMS software

To perform all database operations (Creating/alter/delete DB, Tables, Insert/update/delete records, assigning the permission on the table to other users, querying the tables, computing the data, generating reports, handling DB transactions etc)


DB Objects that can be created in MYSQL

Tables, views, stored procedures, functions, triggers, indexes


Tables : In a DB we can create any no. of tables
where we can store data in Rows and columns with proper validation

Views : virtual tables, we can create view to get the data from one or more tables. we can hide the original objects, unnecessary data.

Stored procedures/Functions : to perform repeated task in a DB we can defined code, once its created it can be used from applications and DB platforms. It increases data fetching speed in Server.

triggers : kind of procedures used to monitor and stop the invalid action on the tables and DB.

Indexes : To organize the table data using key columns, so that we can extract or search data quickly
